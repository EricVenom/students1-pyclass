# students1-pyclass
This is an exercise of my Python course for beginners. 

This program will be using inputs to determine a list of students by their names and their mark points, storing it in a dictionary{}. Then, it will use this data to reward the best 3 with cash prizes. Notice the ones who scored over than 949 mark points, will get an extra congrats.
It's a simple program to test my skills with Functions() and For loops. 

Hope you enjoy it.
